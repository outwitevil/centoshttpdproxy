# to be loaded here.

# LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so

# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.

# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.

# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com

#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.

# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
