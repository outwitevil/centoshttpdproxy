# centoshttpdproxy
I did this for a work project and it proved to be much more involved than I originally thought.  Who knew?!

Anyways.  We're running Centos6 and Apache 2.4.20
Which you can't seem to do out of the box.
So this will actually compile the binaries and everything.
There's a possibility my sources might get broken over time and I will do my best to keep them updated but if you have to update the links that's okay.
